# Phenotypic Similarity of Adverse Drug Reactions and Disease Phenotypes: A Bridge to Mechanistic Discovery

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) continue to hinder the progress of new therapeutic developments and pose significant risks to patients, despite considerable efforts to mitigate drug safety issues. A major contributing factor to this challenge is our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms of ADRs. In this study, we explored whether ADRs and diseases phenotypes (DPs) that share similar clinical manifestations also share mechanistic similarities. This dual perspective could facilitate the precise identification of biological pathways involved. To achieve this, we constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph and applied a graph representation learning technique to quantify the mechanistic similarities between phenotypically similar ADRs and DPs. Our analysis reveals substantial mechanistic overlap among ADRs and DPs within specific system organ classes (SOCs), including cardiac, psychiatric, metabolism, and renal disorders. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with ADRs by integrating drug-induced and disease-related phenotypes, but also suggest that drugs interacting with proteins associated with specific DPs are more prone to inducing ADRs with similar phenotypic manifestations. This approach advocates for the prioritization of drugs that are less likely to result in ADRs, ultimately contributing to the development of safer and more targeted interventions.
