# Phenotypic Similarity of Adverse Drug Reactions and Disease Phenotypes: A Bridge to Mechanistic Discovery

## Project Description
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) remain a significant challenge in drug development and patient safety, often due to our limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether ADRs and disease phenotypes (DPs) that share similar clinical manifestations also share molecular mechanisms. 

## Main Findings
We constructed a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) and applied graph representation learning techniques to quantify the mechanistic similarities between ADRs and DPs. Our analysis revealed substantial mechanistic overlaps within specific system organ classes (SOCs), including cardiac, psychiatric, metabolic, and renal disorders. This approach advocates for the prioritization of drugs that are less likely to result in ADRs, ultimately contributing to the development of safer and more targeted interventions.
